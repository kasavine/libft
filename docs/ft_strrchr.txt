NAME
     strchr, strrchr -- locate character in string

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     char *
     strchr(const char *s, int c);

     char *
     strrchr(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
     The strchr() function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to a char) in
     the string pointed to by s.  The terminating null character is considered to be
     part of the string; therefore if c is `\0', the functions locate the terminating
     `\0'.

     The strrchr() function is identical to strchr(), except it locates the last
     occurrence of c.

RETURN VALUES
     The functions strchr() and strrchr() return a pointer to the located character,
     or NULL if the character does not appear in the string.
