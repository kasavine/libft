NAME
     stpcpy, stpncpy, strcpy, strncpy -- copy strings

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     char *
     stpcpy(char * dst, const char * src);

     char *
     stpncpy(char * dst, const char * src, size_t len);

     char *
     strcpy(char * dst, const char * src);

     char *
     strncpy(char * dst, const char * src, size_t len);

DESCRIPTION
     The stpcpy() and strcpy() functions copy the string src to dst (including the
     terminating `\0' character.)

     The stpncpy() and strncpy() functions copy at most len characters from src into
     dst.  If src is less than len characters long, the remainder of dst is filled
     with `\0' characters.  Otherwise, dst is not terminated.

     The source and destination strings should not overlap, as the behavior is unde-
     fined.

RETURN VALUES
     The strcpy() and strncpy() functions return dst.  The stpcpy() and stpncpy()
     functions return a pointer to the terminating `\0' character of dst.  If
     stpncpy() does not terminate dst with a NUL character, it instead returns a
     pointer to dst[n] (which does not necessarily refer to a valid memory location.)
